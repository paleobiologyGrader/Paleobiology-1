## Article Summary
This paper sets out to refine the definition of 'mass extinction'. Five events have typically been given that name:
the end-Ordovician,the Late Devonian, the end-Permian,the end-Triassic, and the end-Cretaceous. Diversity is the 
product of both extinction and origination: in order for diversity to drop, either extinction must be high or 
origination must be low. The size of an extinction event is also relative. For example, losing one genus is a 
background event in a community with a thousand genera, but a devastating mass extinction in a community with two.
With these concepts in mind, the authors of the paper look at the "Big Five" as "diversity depletions" characterized
by high proportional loss of diversity (extinction) or low proportional origination.  If these five events
are truly distinct from 'normal' extinctions, then they would be obvious outliers on continuous distributions of
extinction, and they would share characteristics that set them apart from less-severe extinction events. Three
concepts are used to measure the continuity of background extinctions into mass extinctions: continuity of
cause, continuity of effect, and continuity of magnitude. In other words, are mass extinctions driven by the same
forces as background extinctions?; are mass extinctions similar to background extinctions in taxonomic, ecological,
or other patterns?; and, are mass extinctions significantly different in severity? While all five of the events
previously described certainly involve depletions of diversity, the degree to which each was caused by extinction
versus origination differs. The end-Triassic and Late Devonian losses can be attributed more to low origination
than high extinction, and their magnitude is in keeping with a continuous distribution of extinction severity. The
other mass extinctions do represent significant outliers from continous background extinction and from their local
conditions. Thus, there is a special class of mass extinctions, but it contains three, not five, members.

## Things you liked about the paper

I think the subheadings in this paper do a good job of separating ideas from one another- a necessary job in a paper
this long. I had taken the idea of mass extinctions for granted; I am glad that these researchers didn't. In
particular, I hadn't thought very much about the equilibrium between extinction and origination, and that an 
"extinction" can be nothing more than a failure of origination to keep up. That I am surprised by the insights in 
this paper is a good thing. That is, after all, how knowledge advances. Additionally, the figures and results are 
referenced elsewhere in the paper in a thoughtful manner to keep the reader focussed on whatever is being discussed.
I found that helpful.   

## Things you didn't like about the paper

While the subheading format was a good way of separating major ideas, within and between individual paragraphs ideas
seem to wander a bit. The digressions were interesting and certainly contributed to the validity of the ideas
the paper was presenting, but I found myself continually distracted from the main 'story' the authors were trying
to tell. Perhaps tidbits, like the "side issue" of large-magnitude proportional increases in diversity, should
be placed nearer the end of the paper. Better yet, "side issues" like that could lead to a full paper in their own
right, where they might better get the attention and recognition they deserve.  

> Stylistic and formatting issues aren't very substantive critiques.

## Evaluate the graphs and figures (if any)

There are nine figures in this article. Because that's too many to give each its own evaluation, and because they
are all relatively similar, I will just discuss some main themes, then go on to specifics only if they are
pertinent. Relationships, usually between extinction and origination or between genus diversity and time, are 
documented using lined scatter plots. For the most part, these graphs are somewhat cluttered with multiple lines
and axes, but are still legible and helpful. I wonder why papers like this don't try colorization as an organizing
tool- some of these relationships would be much clearer if the lines were different colors. Figure 4 might need
more than color, though. I don't think I have ever wanted a paper to be longer before, but if it means that Table
1 can be horizontal and each of the little graphs can be full size, it may well be worth it. That would also allow
each graph to have its own caption instead of sharing a giant block of small print.
