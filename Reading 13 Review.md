## Article Summary
This paper evaluates the hypothesis that the dinosaurs went into decline before the Chicxulub asteroid impact 66
million years ago. According to the authors, this question had not yeet been solved because of improper methodology.
Specifically, the approach taken by previous papers was not explicitly phylogenetic, and did not consider speciation
and extinction rates together. Thus, the net change in the diversity of dinosaur taxa was obscured. The authors used
a linear model to examine trends in dinosaur speciation and extinction. The analyses in this paper found that
dinosaurs were in fact in decline many millions of years before the end of the  Cretaceous. However, 
dinosaurs are not homogeneous; trends differed between separate dinosaur clades. Sauropods went into decline earlier
than other dinosaur clades. For them, extinction surpassed speciation 114 million years ago. Theropod and 
Ornithischian lineages also declined, but less severely. Within Ornithischia, ceratopsians and hadrosaurs were 
spared; their rates of speciation exceeded extinction until the very end of the Cretaceous. The authors' 
explanation for this phenomenon is that ceratopsians and hadrosaurs were better able to exploit changing 
ecological niches through increased provincialism: relatively minor morphological adaptations allowed effective
resource partitioning when different hadrosaur and ceratopsian species coexisted. Interestingly, birds were
not significantly different from non-avian theropods in their rates of speciation or extinction. These declines
could have been caused by  geographic range size restrictions, climate change, or ecological interactions with
rapidly diversifying new taxa. 


## Things you liked about the paper
This paper is very confident and very direct. For example, there is a "significance" box at the end of the first 
page that serves as a further-abbreviated abstract to make absolutely clear what the argument is. Even the title
is aggressive in asserting the paper's final conclusion. The conclusion is definitely worth defending, too; there
is very strong evidence presented that dinosaurs were losing their thrones long before the end of the Mesozoic.
In some ways this level of directness might be necessary. After all, the 
authors are confronting a big issue in dinosaur science, and their results are fairly unorthodox. 

## Things you didn't like about the paper
On the other hand, perhaps the authors have gone too far. There isn't a lot written here about potential limits
or caveats to this study, which is something every paper needs. It's not enough for the authors to just say "our
research is flawless", they need to back it up with an assessment of what could have gone wrong, and what they did
about it. Furthermore, if their results are valid, there may be alternative explanations for the observed rates
of speciation and extinction; there isn't much on that subject here either. In particular, I think they should 
have elaborated on the effects of ecological limits on speciation, and on the question of sea level rise.

> I and many of your peers felt similarly, they do present an overly one-sided look at the issue.

## Evaluate the graphs and figures (if any)
There are three figures depicting the linear patterns of net speciation. Figure 1 is  theoretical model explaining
how their analysis was set up and what their predictions were. Figure 2 is a pair of graphs of the speciation 
slowdowns of the various dinosaur clades, and Figure 3 is the results for net speciation, as well as a diagram of
the different branchings for each clade. All of these figures make excellent use of color to make the lines very
distinct and the results clear, and I think they add a lot to the paper overall.
