## Problem Set 1

1) North America is currently West of its Cretaceous position.

2)

````R
help(plot)
help(rgb)
col=rgb() specifies that the colors should use the rgb() color function. rgb() allows for any combination
of the red, green, and blue primary colors, as well as an opacity value. lty defines the type of line used, and
add= tells R to plot the map on top of the previous one. 
````

3)

````R
AlbianMap<-downloadPaleogeography(Age=110)
````

4)

````R
plot(AlbianMap,col=rgb(0,1,0,0.33),lty=0,add=TRUE)
````

5)
Since the Albian, the Eastern Hemisphere has moved west, but not north or south.

> Hmm.. most people (me included) would say North is the strongest signal (India and Australia, etc.), but whatever!

6)
Since the Albian, the Western Hemisphere has moved west, but not north or south. 

## Problem Set 2

1) 

````R
BaseMap<-downloadPaleogeography(Age=56)
plot(BaseMap,col=rgb(0,1,0,0.33),lty=0.01)

6)

Most of the Anthozoan occurrences in the Eastern Hemisphere are in central Europe. This indicates that Anthozoans
are primarily freshwater organisms, simply because they are generally not found in the oceans. Central Europe,
then, must have had abundant freshwater. 

> Nooooooo. Anthozoans are primarily marine (e.g., corals!). It means that there must have been an epicontinental sea in Europe at that time!! -1 Points

## Problem Set 3

1)

````R
Hooves<-downloadPBDB(Taxa=c("Perissodactyla"),StartInterval="Paleogene",StopInterval="Paleogene")
````

2)

Perissodactyls are mammals with an odd number of toes. They are generally grazers with simple stomachs.

Rhinos, pigs, and horses are perissodactyls.

3)

````R
Piggy<-subset(Hooves,Hooves[,"collection_no"]==112723)
Piggy

4)

````R
The geoplate is 501. 
PaleogeneMap<-downloadPaleogeography(Age=50)
plot(PaleogeneMap)
points(70.7,2.76)
Geoplate 501 is in modern-day northern India. 
````

5)

````R
Piggy<-subset(Hooves,Hooves[,"collection_no"]==112723)
````

6)

India begins near Africa and Antarctica, then gradually travels northeast until it collides with southern Asia.

7)

````R
Using the PBDB Navigator Tool, I found:
1. Perissodactyl fossils first appear in North America, far from both India and China. 
2. Perissodactyl fossils occur in both India and China before there is a land bridge between the two.
I also posit that:
3. Perissodactyls are not good long-distance swimmers. 
````

Therefore, the only plausible explanation is that region x (geoplate 501) and China both received perissodactyls
from a third place.
