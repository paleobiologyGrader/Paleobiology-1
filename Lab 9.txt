CretaceousMap<-downloadPaleogeography(Age=66)
ModernMap<-downloadPaleogeography(Age=0)

Problem Set 1

1) North America is currently West of its Cretaceous position.

2) 
help(plot)
help(rgb)
col=rgb() specifies that the colors should use the rgb() color function. rgb() allows for any combination
of the red, green, and blue primary colors, as well as an opacity value. lty defines the type of line used, and
add= tells R to plot the map on top of the previous one. 

3)
AlbianMap<-downloadPaleogeography(Age=110)

4)
plot(AlbianMap,col=rgb(0,1,0,0.33),lty=0.01,add=TRUE)

5)
Since the Albian, the Eastern Hemisphere has moved west, but not north or south.

6)
Since the Albian, the Western Hemisphere has moved west, but not north or south. 

Problem Set 2

1) 
BaseMap<-downloadPaleogeography(Age=56)
plot(BaseMap,col=rgb(0,1,0,0.33),lty=0.01)

2)
Anthozoa<-downloadPBDB(Taxa=c("Anthozoa"),StartInterval="Paleocene",StopInterval="Eocene")

3)
dim(Anthozoa)
[1] 2847   26
2847 occurences.

4)
+occurrence_no 
which occurrence this is.
+record_type  
What kind of record this is: an occurrence.
+reid_no 
If this occurrence was reidentified, this identifies that reidentification.
+flags  
Whether there are any notifying flags for this occurrence.         
+collection_no
Which collection this occurrence came from.
+identified_name
This object's taxonomic name.
+identified_rank
The rank for the identified name.
+identified_no
 The unique identifier of the name to which this object was assigned. 
+difference
IF the identified name and accepted name are different, here's why. 
+accepted_name 
The accepted taxonomic name of this occurrence.
+accepted_rank  
The taxonomic rank of the accepted name.
+accepted_no    
The unique identifier of the accepted taxonomic name in this database.
+early_interval 
The interval that begins the geologic time range for this occurrence.
+late_interval  
The interval that ends the geologic time range for this occurrence.
+max_ma
 The early bound of this occurrence's geologic time range.     
+min_ma  
The late bound of this occurrence's geologic time range.       
+reference_no 
The identifier of the reference where the database got this data.
+paleomodel   
The primary model specified by the parameter pgm for evaluating paleocoordinates.
+paleolng    
paleolongitude for the paleocoordinates.
+paleolat    
paleolatitude for the paleocoordinates.   
+geoplate   
which geological plate this occurrence lies on.
+
     phylum    } 
      class    }  
     order     } The taxonomic hierarchy for this occurrence.     
[25] family    }
       genus   }

5) 
help(points)
Anthozoalat<-Anthozoa[,"paleolat"]
Anthozoalong<-Anthozoa[,"paleolng"]
points(Anthozoalong,Anthozoalat)

6)
Most of the Anthozoan occurrences in the Eastern Hemisphere are in central Europe. This indicates that Anthozoans
are primarily freshwater organisms, simply because they are generally not found in the oceans. Central Europe,
then, must have had abundant freshwater. 

Problem Set 3
1)
Hooves<-downloadPBDB(Taxa=c("Perissodactyla"),StartInterval="Paleogene",StopInterval="Paleogene")

2)
Perissodactyls are mammals with an odd number of toes. They are generally grazers with simple stomachs.
Rhinos, pigs, and horses are perissodactyls.

3)
Piggy<-subset(Hooves,Hooves[,"collection_no"]==112723)
Piggy

4)
The geoplate is 501. 
PaleogeneMap<-downloadPaleogeography(Age=50)
plot(PaleogeneMap)
points(70.7,2.76)
Geoplate 501 is in modern-day northern India. 


5)
Piggy<-subset(Hooves,Hooves[,"collection_no"]==112723)

6)
India begins near Africa and Antarctica, then gradually travels northeast until it collides with southern Asia.

7)
Using the PBDB Navigator Tool, I found:
1. Perissodactyl fossils first appear in North America, far from both India and China. 
2. Perissodactyl fossils occur in both India and China before there is a land bridge between the two.
I also posit that:
3. Perissodactyls are not good long-distance swimmers. 

Therefore, the only plausible explanation is that region x (geoplate 501) and China both received perissodactyls
from a third place.
