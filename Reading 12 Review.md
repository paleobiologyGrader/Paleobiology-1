## Article Summary

Evolution can be driven by biotic or abiotic factors. The Red Queen model states that evolution is the 
byproduct of competitive interactions between organisms. Conversely, the Court Jester model posits that evolution
only occurs as the result of changes in the physical environment. These models are not necessarily mutually
exclusive. This review evaluates the hypothesis that these models usually operate at different spacial and 
temporal scales. A few key concepts dominate the debate between the Red Queen and the Court Jester. One of the 
ideas is global diversification: how did millions of species originate from a single basal ancestor? Two sub-models
are presented. The saturation/equilibrium model assumes that ecosystems eventually become "saturated", at which
point new species cannot arise without driving existing taxa extinct. Alternatively, the expansionist model
predicts that diversity continues to rise as new habitats or "eco-spaces" become available. While rates of 
extinction and origination appear to be density dependent, especially within the marine fossil record, there is
also abundant evidence of new ecospaces (such as dry land) being invaded by colonists which then diversify widely.
The review argues that any conclusive model must keep all this in mind, and also to take into account instances
of new species appearing without displacing any old one. Another key concept in the Red Queen versus Court Jester
debate is the role of energy in species diversification. Do the tropics have more species than higher latitudes
because there is more energy available for speciation, or because the tropical belt is simply older and larger?
The evidence provides no clear answer. Biodiversity could arise from runaway specialization, which would
explain the gradual increasing trend in species richness over time. Some of these hypotheses can be examined
by studying sister taxa. Overall, the review comes to the conclusion that both the Red Queen and Court Jester
models are useful; the Red Queen is stronger at the local, individual and community level, while the Court 
Jester is stronger over large geographic regions and long stretches of geologic time. 

## Things you liked about the paper

I like this paper because it opens opportunities for dialogue between different scientific disciplines,
like paleontology and ecology. It also acknowledges throughout the text the difficult truth that life is complex
and pluralistic. Scientific debates almost never end with one side being proven unequivocally right and the other
totally wrong. All of the models discussed here are likely true to some degree, and this article invites a synthesis
of each into a more cohesive whole. This paper is well structured: each idea is tucked neatly into a series of
paragraphs under a heading, and ideas flow naturally from one to the next. I notice a few poetic phrases sprinkled
throughout the paper: phrases like "the slow dance of the continents" or "the great blossoming of flowering plants".
They're not exactly scientific statements, but I think they help tell a story and make the reader actually care.

## Things you didn't like about the paper

I enjoyed reading this paper immensely. There is nothing in it that I can reasonably find fault with. 

> Haha, sounds fair enough.

## Evaluate the graphs and figures (if any)

This article has three figures and one table. Figure 1 is a graph of the temporal and environmental scales
at which the Court Jester or the Red Queen prevails. It clearly depicts the Red Queen triumphing at short-term
and local scales, and the Court Jester at longer and larger spacial and temporal intervals. Figure 2 is a graph
of marine genus diversification during the last 530 million years. It shows the difference between uncorrected
and corrected lines: the uncorrected line shows a near-exponential increase in biodiversity, while the uncorrected
one shows a plateau beginning about 400 Mya. Table 1 is a conceptual table of the different mechanisms demonstrated
by the Red Queen and Court Jester models; I found this very helpful in organizing how the models differ and how
they might mix. Figure 3 is a morphospace diagram for Triassic archosaurs, showing how dinosaurs did not
necessarily outcompete the previous ruling reptiles so much as take up their mantle after they disappeared.
